# Jellyfin_Testing
Automation Tests for Jellyfin Media Server


These are just quick tests (for now) using the Jellyfin demo (see http://jellyfin.org) media server. 

Code is being written using Eclipse IDE and the following libraries are installed using RED (See https://marketplace.eclipse.org/category/free-tagging/robotframework): 
- SeleniumLibrary
- Robot Framework 3.2rc1 (Python 3.7.7) 


While I realize the way these files are set up/organized is probably not ideal, they work. And considering I have zero formal training, I think that's pretty amazing and goes to show just how easy Robot Framework is to use.
