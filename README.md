# Jellyfin_Testing
Automation Tests for Jellyfin Media Server


These are just quick tests (for now) using my local Jellyfin (see http://jellyfin.org) media server. 

The IP address listed in the file is local to my network, as is the password (Jellyfin configured to use a pin for local network access instead of a password)
